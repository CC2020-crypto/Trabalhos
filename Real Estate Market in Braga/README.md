# Real Estate Market for Financial Investments in Braga

#The Real Estate Market in Braga Dashboard

#All around the world, the real estate market attracts hundreds of millions of euros every year. Despite some major disruptions in the context of the ﬁnancial crisis, the real estate market remains as one of the major and most stable markets suitable for investments at various scales. Big investment groups and institutions have the knowledge and resources to gather and analyze all sorts of information regarding this market. On the other hand, it is hard for individual investors to make informed decisions about assets in which to invest in because of the lack of knowledge and resources. The information that exists in current real estate online platforms provides low value for investors looking to make an informed decision. 

This lowers the possibility of success of the individual investor. The investor is forced to perform intensive hands-on research in order to analyze all the important details or ends up making decisions based in tendencies and/or marketing materials. All in all, the retrieval of this information seems to be challenging because it exists in several different locations and is presented and structured in distinct ways. Considering the problem at hand, this project proposes the development of a web scraper for the selected sources of relevant data. By cleaning, storing and modeling this data in a ﬂexible data structure it will enable the development of an online aggregation platform for real estate market data. On top of the normal search and listing criteria that current platforms allow for, investors will also have access to price analysis by time, area and location. The platform shall also present the results of a classiﬁcation task that was performed by extracting relevant features from the data gathered. This solution will enable a deeper understanding of the real estate market landscape and provide a unique, centralized and insightful source of information for potential investors.
