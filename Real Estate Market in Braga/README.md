# Real Estate Market Data Scraping and Analysis for Financial Investments

#The Real Estate Market in Braga Dashboard

#All around the world, the real estate market attracts hundreds of millions of euros every year. Despite
some major disruptions in the context of the ﬁnancial crisis, the real estate market remains
as one of the major and most stable markets suitable for investments at various scales. Big investment
groups and institutions have the knowledge and resources to gather and analyze all sorts
of information regarding this market. On the other hand, it is hard for individual investors to
make informed decisions about assets in which to invest in because of the lack of knowledge and
resources.
The information that exists in current real estate online platforms provides low value for investors
looking to make an informed decision. Often, relevant information is not disclosed and
there are no indicators of property value and its ﬂuctuations. This lowers the possibility of success
of the individual investor. The investor is forced to perform intensive hands-on research in order to
analyze all the important details or ends up making decisions based in tendencies and/or marketing
materials. All in all, the retrieval of this information seems to be challenging because it exists in
several different locations and is presented and structured in distinct ways.
Considering the problem at hand, this project proposes the development of a web scraper for
the selected sources of relevant data. By cleaning, storing and modeling this data in a ﬂexible data
structure it will enable the development of an online aggregation platform for real estate market
data. On top of the normal search and listing criteria that current platforms allow for, investors
will also have access to price analysis by time, area and location. The platform shall also present
the results of a classiﬁcation task that was performed by extracting relevant features from the data
gathered. The model built with these aims to predict the ﬂuctuations of the asset’s prices.
This solution will enable a deeper understanding of the real estate market landscape and provide
a unique, centralized and insightful source of information for potential investors.
